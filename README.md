# 🌐 Lumier Rodriguez – AI Workflow & SaaS Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a professional, modern single-page site showcasing my skills, certifications, and selected work in business analysis, automation, and SaaS implementation.

Deployed via **GitHub Pages**, this site is designed using **Tailwind CSS** and follows a clean, grid-based layout inspired by Instagram feeds and SaaS product design.
